
implement getter / setter in source and header, just for testing
add namespace to header
check queue nullptr in read, write, emptyQueue, etc
remove isEmpty

read function:
bool queue_read(queue_t *queue, int &data);
and to check if a queue is empty there is no need to
have isEmpty as a member of node_t. You could check if
element_counter is zero or not.

add function to check if queue is full
emptyQueue does not work, use element_counter, not interate
handle potential allocation error, and release memory
